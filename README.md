# hyprland-dispatcher
A simple service meant to provide callbacks to Hyprland events

# WARNING!

This is a convenience package for my desktop setup and is in very, **very** early development.

While the basic structure will probably stay mostly the same, I will be toying with different methods of providing runtime variables and dynamic callback functions.

You have been warned.
